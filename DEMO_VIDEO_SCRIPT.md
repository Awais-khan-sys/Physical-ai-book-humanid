## Alternative: Static Clips Version

If screen recording is challenging, you can:
1. Take screenshots of each scene
2. Import into video editor (DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, iMovie)
3. Add Ken Burns effect (slow zoom/pan) to each image
4. Apply transitions as specified
5. Add text overlays
6. Export as video

**Duration per clip**:
- Landing: 10s

## Quick Recording Tips

1. **Rehearse** the flow 2-3 times before recording
2. **Pre-type** questions in a text file to copy-paste (faster, typo-free)
3. **Slow down** cursor movements (easier to follow)
4. **Pause** 2-3 seconds on key screens (gives viewers time to read)
5. **Test** the chatbot responses beforehand (know what to expect)
