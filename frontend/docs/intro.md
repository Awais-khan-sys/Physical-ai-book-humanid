# Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of AI

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through embodied agents—robots that can perceive, reason, and act in real environments. This textbook explores the cutting-edge field of humanoid robotics, where AI systems take human-like form to interact naturally with our world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that:
- Operate in the physical world through robotic embodiments
- Perceive their environment through sensors (vision, touch, proprioception)
- Make decisions in real-time based on sensory input
- Execute actions that affect the physical world
- Learn from interactions with their environment

## Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots offer unique advantages:

1. **Human-Centric Design**: Our world is built for humans—doors, stairs, tools, vehicles. Humanoid form factors allow robots to navigate and manipulate existing infrastructure without modification.

2. **Natural Interaction**: Human-like appearance and behavior facilitate intuitive communication and collaboration with people.

3. **Versatility**: A general-purpose humanoid platform can perform diverse tasks across multiple domains.

4. **Learning from Humans**: Humanoid robots can learn by observing and imitating human demonstrations.
